# The Only Elixir & Phoenix Learning Kit you will ever need
{: .fs-9 }


## What to expect from this kit?
### After utlising this kit completely, you would:
#### - Understand where exactly Elixir & Phoenix are used in the industry
#### - Know when-to/when-not-to use phoenix & elixir
#### - Understand the possibilities and future of the language
#### - Understand Basic Fundamentals of Elixir Language
#### - Understand the folder structure and git integration of an Elixir Project
#### - Create 2 simple projects in Elixir 
#### - Understand Basic Fundamentals of Phoenix Language
#### - Understand the folder structure and git integration of a Phoenix Project
#### - Create 1 Advanced Project in Phoenix
#### - Know how to make money from whatever you've learnt (Job / Freelancing)
#### - Get the roadmap / learning path to becoming a master in Elixir & Phoenix
#### - Get the roadmap to building a realistic application at scale using Elixir & Phoenix
#### - Get curated resources from the best books, articles, videos and docs regarding the language and framework
###### All of this explained in Layman terms (No Jargons, No complex terminology)

## This Kit is geared towards

#### - Newbie Programmers who want to learn Elixir
#### - Add another skill-set to their Resume


### Should you learn Elixir & Phoenix while learning another language like JavaScript?

The single answer is: Absolutely Yes! It can be very helpful if you're learning 2 languages at the same time. In that way, 

- You can learn the idiomatic way of writing a particular language
- You can learn why a programming language was built that way
- Finally, it's always easier to learn concepts by analogy and by comparison

## 🏓 Pre-requisites

##### Anybody learning from this kit, must
#### - i. Have an idea of how code exactly works 
#### - ii. Have a brief understanding of how Git & Github works (Github is probably the place where you found this kit in the first place 😜)
#### - iii. Be familier with any code editor   

## Characteristics of this Kit

#### - This kit has been designed keeping in mind the newbie developer
#### - This kit explains most concepts using an analogy (think Explain-Like-I'm-5)
#### - This kit focuses more on Project-Based Learning and allows you to try out code by yourself.
#### - The resources given in this Kit are up-to-date as of June 2020

### Learning Elixir and Phoenix is tectonic, given the feeble amount of resources present online and the scope of the topic being very wide. 
There is a lack of good resources online. Most of the content is either outdated or irrelevent as of 2020. The current documentation of both Elixir and Phoenix is difficult to understand. There is no clear roadmap as to how to progress in the Elixir-Phoenix Journey. Most people don't know if Phoenix is the right choice for them. This repo provides the roadmap, main concept guides, cheatsheets, project based learning, and important resources along the way.

# First Things First

### The following notes are Inspired from Stephen Grider's *The Complete Elixir & Phoenix Bootcamp*

I highly recommend this course, as it explains the fundamentals of everything Elixir & Phoenix required for you to create your own applications.

Also, the course invariably explains all the concepts using 3 fun projects to work with.

Please buy the course on Udemy.com [Link Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/)

P.S.: I do not endorse this course nor do I have any affiliation with the author of the course. This is my personal recommendation as I have completed the course, and was able to use it to create the notes that I have in the document below.

## THE BIRD EYE VIEW
What you will acheive after having gone through this entire documentation?
1. 

# Elixir & Phoenix - Zero to Hero

## Why this Repo?

There is a lack of good resources online. Most of the content is either outdated or irrelevent as of 2020. The current documentation of both Elixir and Phoenix is difficult to understand. There is no clear roadmap as to how to progress in the Elixir-Phoenix Journey. Most people don't know if Phoenix is the right choice for them. This repo provides the roadmap, main concept guides, cheatsheets, project based learning, and important resources along the way.

This repo is a single source of truth, that can make you aware of the entire landscape of Elixir and Phoenix. This guide transforms your idea of

###### Elixir

> From a magic potion to a functional and extremely robust programming language.

##### &

###### Phoenix

> From a bird to fully-scalable modern web-development framework.

🌟Give a GitHub Star if you understood the joke over there!🤣
